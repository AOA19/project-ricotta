# Project Ricotta

Project Ricotta is a volunteer effort to build a new web and mobile platform for [Lasagna Love](https://www.lasagnalove.org) volunteers.

## Contributing

We welcome (and appreciate) contributions from the community! Give this guide a quick read to ensure your contribution goes as smoothly as possible.

If you are a contributor from outside our project, please fork the repo and send us a PR from your fork.

Members of the project should create named branches, ideally namespaced to your user. For example, a Github user named Jo Doe would run `git checkout -b jodoe/my-contribution` to organize their contribution branches.

Once you're ready, open a [pull request](https://github.com/Lasagna-Love-Portal/project-ricotta/pulls) with a clear description of your changes (you can read more about pull requests on GitHub [here](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

When you send a pull request, please be sure to include:

- Unit tests that validate that your changes work as expected.
- Use concise code comments (it can help to imagine that you are explaining your code to a total stranger).
- Examples, if necessary.

## Project Background
